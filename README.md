## Introduction


People's experience with Police enforcement varies wildly, but ethnicity and race are far too often a factor in that experience. There is a significant disparity and inequality in policing presence, incarceration rates, police brutality, etc., in the United States. This essay will look specifically at arrests in the state of New York from 2006 to 2019. It will identify biases and why minorities are arrested disproportionately more per capita, specifically black people. In New York, the population estimation from the U.S. Census Bureau (2019) is 69.6%-Whites, 17.6%-Black, 19.3%-Hispanic, 9.0%-Asian. The NYPD's Historic arrest Data black people comprise 48% of all arrests, while white individuals make up 12%.

| **Ethnicity** | **Percentage** | **Total Arrests** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| BLACK | 0.485444 | 2433510 |
| WHITE HISPANIC | 0.260037 | 1303555 |
| WHITE | 0.120666 | 604892 |
| BLACK HISPANIC | 0.080398 | 403034 |
| ASIAN / PACIFIC ISLANDER | 0.040935 | 205205 |
| UNKNOWN | 0.010043 | 50347 |
| AMERICAN INDIAN/ALASKAN NATIVE | 0.002204 | 11050 |
| OTHER | 0.000272 | 1363 |



Despite being 17.6% of the population, black people were arrested four times more often, adjusting for population. In this period, black people had arrests per capita (BLACK: 0.71, WHITE: 0.044) 16 times larger than white people.

## Stop, Frisk, and Bias

The NYPD implemented the controversial policy Stop and Frisk. The program empowers police offers to act on suspicions generated from racial stereotypes. The program was heavily criticized for apparent racial profiling. Nearly 76% of people stopped under the stop and frisk program are innocent; 90% of recorded stops in 2016 and 2017 were people of colour, says Stolper(2018).

&quot;_We did find evidence of stops that are best explained as &quot;racial incongruity&quot; stops: high rates of minority stops in predominantly white precincts. Indeed, being &quot;out of place&quot; is often a trigger for suspicion… Racial incongruity stops are most prominent in racially homogeneous areas. For example, we observed high stop rates of African-Americans in the predominantly white 19th Precinct, a sign of race-based selection of citizens for police interdiction&quot;_ (Gelman et al., 2007)

Stolper(2018) describes racial disparities in fare evasion arrests, more than 94 percent of all stops occurred within a half kilometre of a subway station. He notes that more fare evasion arrests were made in high crime areas. A bias presents itself as high crime areas that are predominantly Black and Hispanic were stopped more than high crime areas that are predominantly White. This pattern can be seen most plainly in Manhattan for fare evasion, but the pattern transfers over for all types of arrests made. This heat map shows all recorded arrests in New York in areas with at least 50 arrests from 2006 to 2019. Gelman et al. (2007) notes that the NYPD's records indicate that they stopped people of colour more often than whites, even when the best estimates of the rate of crimes committed by each group were considered. In 2013 the US District Court determined that the NYPD must produce detailed data for any and all stops.

Since 2013 this disproportionate gap has decreased significantly; there were 55% fewer arrests for people of colour in 2019 vs. 2006. It is clear that racial stereotyping and bias has had a considerable influence in policing in New York; before the stricter criteria for stop and frisks were put in place, 88% of all stops were innocent when the stricter criteria were put into place, stop and frisk innocence only dropped 12% while people of colour saw a sharp decline in arrests, black people were arrested 46% less, but with 90% of stops still being people of colour the bias still persists in NYPD.

## Prepetuation and Intergenerational incarceration

The high arrest rate among people of colour isn’t solely due to discrimination and racial profiling. A part of the issue is perpetuating behaviours in communities of colour. Swisher (2012) finds that a biological father’s incarceration during childhood is associated with increased delinquency for all youth, with very little difference between race groups. The high levels of youth delinquency encourage police presence and enforcement, perpetuating racial stereotypes; this, in turn, leads to fathers’ incarceration, in a self-fulfilling cycle it is decimating communities of colour. The intergenerational effect of incarceration is a significant risk factor, Roettger(2011) found parental incarceration was a powerful influence creating many adverse outcomes such as antisocial behaviour and offending, to decreasing psychological well-being and even socioeconomic attainments in adulthood.

Intergenerational incarceration is just one of many factors in the disproportionate participation in criminal activities and delinquency. Although Police Policy has a vital role in the arrest and incarceration of young men, Western (2009) found that the paths from concentrated economic disadvantage to mass imprisonment run partly through the mechanism of crime. Economically disadvantaged men are more likely to go to prison than others at any given point in time.

&quot;_Black Americans&#39; higher crime rates are a function of their greater exposure to criminogenic conditions: concentrated disadvantage, low collective efficacy, and a cultural landscape divorced from mainstream society. Thus, some scholars predict that the crime rates for Black Americans would more closely resemble those of White Americans if a greater number of Black Americans lived in communities that more closely resembled those of White Americans&quot;_ (Martin et al., 2011).

Martin et al.(2011) identified the issues black Americans face that explains the disproportionate presence in crime rates; they suggest that Improving the structural conditions would reduce Black Americans' overrepresentation in crime statistics.
## Conclusion

New York's arrests data has a clear disproportionate overrepresentation of people of colour; although making up 17% of the population, black people were responsible for 45% of the arrests made. The disproportionate arrests made by police in New York can be explained through the socio-economic situation that faces people of colour, but a significant factor, in this case, was discriminatory policy, stop and frisk. The policy allows officers to act upon racial stereotypes actively and subconsciously. Before regulation, stop and frisk had an 88% innocence rate; after regulation it dropped to 76%, but black arrests dropped by 46%, even with 90% of stops being people of colour, Identifying a clear racial bias towards people of colour in New York,

## Appendix

2020 has been a divisive year; with racial tensions at an all-time high; everyone should step back and look at the facts and problems. The problems facing people of colour are complex. Although racism, police, and policy play a vital role in the issues facing people of colour, they aren't all to blame and are only a piece in the complex socio-economic problem. We must understand that Bias exists, and it's important to identify so we can understand the situation. This data is essential because it identifies policing behaviours such as a policy that negatively affects people of colour.
